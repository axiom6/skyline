Judgment | Common Signs

    Makes choice that puts their safety at risk
    Cannot evaluate the relative risk of a situation
    Has difficulty determining the important from the unimportant
    Finds themselves in situations they are not prepared for because of poor judgment (e.g. out in the cold without a jacket)
    Cannot think of the outcome of their decision
    Misjudges the intentions of other people
    Difficulty judging their ability to complete a task


Judgment | General Description

The ability to exercise judgment, weigh facts, and organize and sequence information is progressively affected in all dementias, and can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease . As a result, the person you care for may no longer be able to judge or evaluate a situation properly. The person you care for may find themselves in a situation that they are not prepared for because of poor judgment (e.g. going shopping in their pyjamas). They may even find themselves in a situation that puts their safety at risk due to their poor judgment. For example, they may get into the car of a stranger if they are tired and do not want to walk home. Often, the cause of poor judgment is that the person you care for cannot predict the outcome of their decisions. Difficulty with judgment can be an embarrassing part of Alzheimer's disease for both the patient and for the caregiver. It is part of the problem of executive function which is common in dementia.

Commonly in Frontotemporal dementia , as judgment becomes impaired, risk taking behaviour increases. Also, the person is unable to understand the outcome of his/her decisions. In situations where the person with Frontotemporal dementia is still employed or controls the finances, poor financial judgment can produce additional, troubling situations for families. Also, poor judgments regarding the care of a vulnerable person like a child or frail/infirmed adult, could lead to a disastrous situation and a crisis within the family.

In today's busy world, keeping track of symptoms can be a challenge to say the least. That is why we have developed SymptomGuideTM. By taking a more active role, you can better understand how a symptom is affecting everyday life and you can communicate this knowledge with others involved. 




Stress can also cause individuals to suffer impaired judgement, according to the Mayo Clinic. This is because stress makes it difficult for people to think things through before making decisions. Studies also show that individuals over the age of 70 have an increased risk of suffering cognitive impairments such as impaired judgement if they consume a diet high in carbohydrates and sugar.

Stress and Decision Making: Avoid Expensive Mistakes

Some people respond well in stressful situations and some people lose focus and can make costly mistakes. But why does stress cause many people to have impaired decision making? The survival mechanisms that make up the stress response are very primitive in origin.

Have you ever made a bad decision? Some people respond well in stressful situations and some people lose focus and can make costly mistakes. But why does stress cause many people to have impaired decision making?

The survival mechanisms that make up the stress response are very primitive in origin. These date back well before the development of a cognitive process, such as decision making. In fact, humans, alone, have the ability to analyze and decide about our actions in this deliberate and logical way. Human brains still have the primitive responses for survival "hard-wired" into the mechanism of response to stress/threats. When stressed, the more basic and primitive parts of the human brain take over. The middle and lower brain (the more primitive parts of the human brain) which can react more quickly to threats by preparing you to fight or flee can become dominant. The logical, "thinking" part of the upper brain (Neo-cortex) shut down and good decisions are placed lower as a survival priority. In our complex society the non-thinking reactions to stress can get you in trouble.

"Impulse-control" has become legislated, for good reasons.

Impaired Decision Making
When we are stressed it is common to have several reactions that reduce effective decision making including:

1. Pre-occupation with an idea, even if it is old or ineffective. We do this because we fear new ideas or activities as a response to being overwhelmed and stressed. We tend to do things the way we always have done, rather than using new ways or new technologies.
2. Our concentration is impaired. Too much internal "noise" and distraction from our fear/stress. This is like studying in a large, noisy room and expecting to process important information for later use. We become much more sensitive to environmental distractions.
3. There is a deterioration in judgment and logical thinking. Neo-cortex shuts down and we become more reactive.
4. We can fall more easily into negative self-evaluations as stress affects our self-esteem and self-confidence. Negative thinking and self-criticism are not useful to move forward in a positive direction.
5. We have less objectivity for a reality-check that can show the overall position in the "bigger" picture.
6. Creativity is reduced. We see fewer alternatives and this reduces the brainstorming necessary for appropriate problem solving.
7. Our search for input of useful information is impaired.
8. We fail to see and understand the long-term consequences of decisions. This can lead to serious mistakes.
9. We do not communicate as effectively to get input, to make good decisions, and then to communicate and motivate people to get the required actions to successfully carry out a decision.
