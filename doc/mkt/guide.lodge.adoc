    McGregor Mountain Lodge

Come enjoy a romantic weekend away at McGregor! We are nestled on the slopes of McGregor Mountain with panoramic views of the Continental Divide, Deer Mountain and Sundance Mountain. Being only one-half mile from the Fall River entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, our property offers easy access to over 350 miles of hiking trails. We are bordered on the North by the National Park, so wildlife, including Bighorn Sheep, Elk, Mule Deer and many others, are common sights throughout the year. While being located in the natural beauty of the area, we are also only four and a half miles from the conveniences of downtown Estes Park where many shops, restaurants, and other attractions adorn our quaint mountain village. Spend a day in the park or in town and come “home” to relax by your own crackling fire while taking in the great views!
Our cabins, suites and rooms are furnished in keeping with the surrounding mountains and habitat. Solid pine furniture, natural and rustic accents, and pictures of native flowers and wildlife reflect our casual high country setting. We are known for our outstanding views and the cleanliness of our accommodations. Come be our guest!
