Recent Estes Park reviews

    Christmas in the Rockies!
    "With our kids and grandkids split between two states, it is rare for our whole family to spend Christmas together. But 2016 we treated our kids and grandkids to a week in the Rockies. This beautiful 5 bedroom home was clean and had amazing views from all rooms. Four of the bedrooms had private baths. The kitchen was large and fairly well stocked. The sauna off the master bedroom was used a few times. Had we known the hot tub was still available, that would also have been used. Steve was very helpful with reservations, answering questions and providing an extra space heater for basement area. The location was conveniently close to town for shopping, yet secluded enough for privacy. It snowed the day we left! We did experienced high wind gusts while there and were thankful the living room windows were strong enough to withstand it! A drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is always beautiful to us with breathtaking views around every bend. As in some other reviews, there were a couple things within the house that needed attention and/or updating (lightbulb replacements, ceiling fan in master bedroom); but all-in-all we enjoyed our time together at Rocky Top very much. Thank you for sharing your home! The Charlans"

    Perfect!
    "First, the owners are great, Diane was super responsive and answered any question I had before and during the stay. Second, is the house itself, the location was fantastic, and you can really tell that the owners care about the house. It was super clean and there was no detail missed, everything we needed was there, which I find is rare in my experience with renting vacation homes. It was definitely the most well appointed home we've rented and by far had the most comfortable bed. Getting a good nights sleep and feeling rested for the days adventures is important so one thing I like to point out is whether or not a bed is comfortable, and this one was :) We will definitely consider this our first choice place to stay should we find ourselves in Estes Park again!"

    The two houses provide great family space. Lots of porch and deck space for gathering.
    "The property is in great location for visiting Rocky Mountain National Park. With two fully equipped kitchens meals were fun and easy. Lots of space inside and out. Beautiful views."

    Loved it!
    "We had been on a 3 week trip, staying in other properties. This was our favorite! The location was great - the elk came to graze right behind the condo - great views of the mountains. We especially liked the decor and the furnishings. The condo was very clean and well stocked. We would love to stay here again."

    "We had been on a 3 week trip, staying in other properties. This was our favorite! The location was great - the elk came to graze right behind the condo - great views of the mountains. We especially liked the decor and the furnishings. The condo was very clean and well stocked. We would love to stay here again."

Recent Estes Park reviews

    Christmas in the Rockies!
    "With our kids and grandkids split between two states, it is rare for our whole family to spend Christmas together. But 2016 we treated our kids and grandkids to a week in the Rockies. This beautiful 5 bedroom home was clean and had amazing views from all rooms. Four of the bedrooms had private baths. The kitchen was large and fairly well stocked. The sauna off the master bedroom was used a few times. Had we known the hot tub was still available, that would also have been used. Steve was very helpful with reservations, answering questions and providing an extra space heater for basement area. The location was conveniently close to town for shopping, yet secluded enough for privacy. It snowed the day we left! We did experienced high wind gusts while there and were thankful the living room windows were strong enough to withstand it! A drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is always beautiful to us with breathtaking views around every bend. As in some other reviews, there were a couple things within the house that needed attention and/or updating (lightbulb replacements, ceiling fan in master bedroom); but all-in-all we enjoyed our time together at Rocky Top very much. Thank you for sharing your home! The Charlans"

    Perfect!
    "First, the owners are great, Diane was super responsive and answered any question I had before and during the stay. Second, is the house itself, the location was fantastic, and you can really tell that the owners care about the house. It was super clean and there was no detail missed, everything we needed was there, which I find is rare in my experience with renting vacation homes. It was definitely the most well appointed home we've rented and by far had the most comfortable bed. Getting a good nights sleep and feeling rested for the days adventures is important so one thing I like to point out is whether or not a bed is comfortable, and this one was :) We will definitely consider this our first choice place to stay should we find ourselves in Estes Park again!"

    Christmas in the Rockies!
    "With our kids and grandkids split between two states, it is rare for our whole family to spend Christmas together. But 2016 we treated our kids and grandkids to a week in the Rockies. This beautiful 5 bedroom home was clean and had amazing views from all rooms. Four of the bedrooms had private baths. The kitchen was large and fairly well stocked. The sauna off the master bedroom was used a few times. Had we known the hot tub was still available, that would also have been used. Steve was very helpful with reservations, answering questions and providing an extra space heater for basement area. The location was conveniently close to town for shopping, yet secluded enough for privacy. It snowed the day we left! We did experienced high wind gusts while there and were thankful the living room windows were strong enough to withstand it! A drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is always beautiful to us with breathtaking views around every bend. As in some other reviews, there were a couple things within the house that needed attention and/or updating (lightbulb replacements, ceiling fan in master bedroom); but all-in-all we enjoyed our time together at Rocky Top very much. Thank you for sharing your home! The Charlans"

    Perfect!
    "First, the owners are great, Diane was super responsive and answered any question I had before and during the stay. Second, is the house itself, the location was fantastic, and you can really tell that the owners care about the house. It was super clean and there was no detail missed, everything we needed was there, which I find is rare in my experience with renting vacation homes. It was definitely the most well appointed home we've rented and by far had the most comfortable bed. Getting a good nights sleep and feeling rested for the days adventures is important so one thing I like to point out is whether or not a bed is comfortable, and this one was :) We will definitely consider this our first choice place to stay should we find ourselves in Estes Park again!"

    "We had been on a 3 week trip, staying in other properties. This was our favorite! The location was great - the elk came to graze right behind the condo - great views of the mountains. We especially liked the decor and the furnishings. The condo was very clean and well stocked. We would love to stay here again."

The location was conveniently close to town for shopping, yet secluded enough for privacy. It snowed the day we left! We did experienced high wind gusts while there and were thankful the living room windows were strong enough to withstand it! A drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is always beautiful to us with breathtaking views around every bend. As in some other reviews, there were a couple things within the house that needed attention and/or updating (lightbulb replacements, ceiling fan in master bedroom); but all-in-all we enjoyed our time together at Rocky Top very much.

Recent Estes Park reviews

    Christmas in the Rockies!
    "With our kids and grandkids split between two states, it is rare for our whole family to spend Christmas together. But 2016 we treated our kids and grandkids to a week in the Rockies. This beautiful 5 bedroom home was clean and had amazing views from all rooms. Four of the bedrooms had private baths. The kitchen was large and fairly well stocked. The sauna off the master bedroom was used a few times. Had we known the hot tub was still available, that would also have been used. Steve was very helpful with reservations, answering questions and providing an extra space heater for basement area. The location was conveniently close to town for shopping, yet secluded enough for privacy. It snowed the day we left! We did experienced high wind gusts while there and were thankful the living room windows were strong enough to withstand it! A drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is always beautiful to us with breathtaking views around every bend. As in some other reviews, there were a couple things within the house that needed attention and/or updating (lightbulb replacements, ceiling fan in master bedroom); but all-in-all we enjoyed our time together at Rocky Top very much. Thank you for sharing your home! The Charlans"

    Perfect!
    "First, the owners are great, Diane was super responsive and answered any question I had before and during the stay. Second, is the house itself, the location was fantastic, and you can really tell that the owners care about the house. It was super clean and there was no detail missed, everything we needed was there, which I find is rare in my experience with renting vacation homes. It was definitely the most well appointed home we've rented and by far had the most comfortable bed. Getting a good nights sleep and feeling rested for the days adventures is important so one thing I like to point out is whether or not a bed is comfortable, and this one was :) We will definitely consider this our first choice place to stay should we find ourselves in Estes Park again!"

    The two houses provide great family space. Lots of porch and deck space for gathering.
    "The property is in great location for visiting Rocky Mountain National Park. With two fully equipped kitchens meals were fun and easy. Lots of space inside and out. Beautiful views."

    "We had been on a 3 week trip, staying in other properties. This was our favorite! The location was great - the elk came to graze right behind the condo - great views of the mountains. We especially liked the decor and the furnishings. The condo was very clean and well stocked. We would love to stay here again."

Recent Estes Park reviews

    Christmas in the Rockies!
    "With our kids and grandkids split between two states, it is rare for our whole family to spend Christmas together. But 2016 we treated our kids and grandkids to a week in the Rockies. This beautiful 5 bedroom home was clean and had amazing views from all rooms. Four of the bedrooms had private baths. The kitchen was large and fairly well stocked. The sauna off the master bedroom was used a few times. Had we known the hot tub was still available, that would also have been used. Steve was very helpful with reservations, answering questions and providing an extra space heater for basement area. The location was conveniently close to town for shopping, yet secluded enough for privacy. It snowed the day we left! We did experienced high wind gusts while there and were thankful the living room windows were strong enough to withstand it! A drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is always beautiful to us with breathtaking views around every bend. As in some other reviews, there were a couple things within the house that needed attention and/or updating (lightbulb replacements, ceiling fan in master bedroom); but all-in-all we enjoyed our time together at Rocky Top very much. Thank you for sharing your home! The Charlans"

    Perfect!
    "First, the owners are great, Diane was super responsive and answered any question I had before and during the stay. Second, is the house itself, the location was fantastic, and you can really tell that the owners care about the house. It was super clean and there was no detail missed, everything we needed was there, which I find is rare in my experience with renting vacation homes. It was definitely the most well appointed home we've rented and by far had the most comfortable bed. Getting a good nights sleep and feeling rested for the days adventures is important so one thing I like to point out is whether or not a bed is comfortable, and this one was :) We will definitely consider this our first choice place to stay should we find ourselves in Estes Park again!"

    "We had been on a 3 week trip, staying in other properties. This was our favorite! The location was great - the elk came to graze right behind the condo - great views of the mountains. We especially liked the decor and the furnishings. The condo was very clean and well stocked. We would love to stay here again."
